### Pre-Requisites

You must have passed Math 253 Pre-Algebra, or placed into Math 201 Elementary Algebra. Please note that Math 206 does not substitute for Math 203 Intermediate Algebra as a pre-requisite, except for Math 13 Introduction to Statistics.

The following students are not eligible for this course:  those who intend to major in mathematics, science, engineering, computer science, business, nursing, or nutrition, and/or those intending to take courses such as biology, chemistry, economics, computer science, pre-calculus and calculus that require Math 203 (intermediate algebra) as a pre-requisite. Math 206 does not substitute for Math 203 as a pre-requisite, except for Math 13.

This course is uniquely designed as a preparation for Math 13 Introduction to Statistics, and thus is intended only for students who want to transfer to a 4-year college and need Math 13 to meet their transfer requirements.  Students are expected to take Math 13 next semester at BCC.  Students who want an AA/AS degree will need both Math 206 and Math13 to meet the AA/AS degree requirements.



### Content

Integrated developmental mathematics for statistics: Exploratory data analysis and principles of data production using ratios, rates, and proportional reasoning; fractions, decimals and percents; evaluating expressions; analyzing algebraic forms of statistical measures; modeling bivariate data with linear and exponential functions; and graphical and numerical descriptive statistics for quantitative and categorical data.



### Computer Access

You must have regular access to the web outside of class for reading the online interactive text, taking online quizzes, and using data analysis software.



### Online Text

The text for this course is a $20 (to be confirmed) online text, available at Open Learning Initiative (OLI). OLI: Units 2, 3, 4 and 6. The modules cover the following topics: 
Types of Statistical Studies and Producing Data (unit 2)
Summarizing Data Graphically and Numerically (unit 3)
Examining Relations of Quantitative Data (unit 4)
and Relations in Categorical Data with Intro to Probability (unit 6)

Your computer may need to be correctly configured to use the OLI materials, and you may also need to download some software.  The interactive text contains questions that you answer and check for correctness.  The text is not fully supported on computer tablets or smartphones.



### Course Packet

The course packet is about 350 pages in length and contains daily class exercises and project assignments. It can be purchased only at the BCC bookstore on the 5th floor. It retails for $28.50 + tax.



### Class Style

A lot of time will be spent working collaboratively with other students. You will work in groups of 3-4 students that are randomly configured on a daily basis. Students will be expected to explore new topics together without an initial lecture. Lecture time is minimized.



### Homework Assignments

There are two types of homework assignments. 

- __Interactive OLI exercises.__ These exercises are embedded in the OLI text.  You will not be graded on whether you answer these correctly, but merely on whether you do the exercises at all.  Attempting 100% of the exercises yields a grade of 100%.  You are encouraged to do these with other students.  You will receive 9 separate grades, one for each of the nine OLI modules.  Each HW will be due by a specified date; there is no credit for late work.
- __Project assignments.__ There are 10 project assignments included as part of your reader.  We will begin work on each project during class time, but you will be expected to complete the project as part of homework.  Almost all projects require you to utilize the data analysis software, Statcrunch (see below).  You will be writing small project papers that will be peer-graded, and you will have an opportunity to contest your grade if dissatisfied.  Each project will be due by a specified date; there is no credit for late work.  Your lowest project grade will be dropped.



### Quizzes

- There are about 11 online (at OLI) "checkpoint" quizzes with multiple choice questions.
- These will be automatically graded by the computer.
- Each quiz must be taken online before the next class day after it is assigned.
- The computer will check your quiz answers and provide you with a grade.
- If you don’t take the quiz by the specified date, you will receive a 0 grade for that quiz.
- You will need to read the online text and do the interactive exercises for each OLI topic before beginning the checkpoint quiz.
- You will be able to take each quiz twice to improve your grade.
- You are encouraged to take the quizzes with other students.



### Exams

There will be 2 exams, plus a comprehensive final exam. Exams consist primarily of open-ended questions, with just some True/False or multiple choice questions.  2-2.5 hours, closed book, closed notes.  

If you are going to be absent for an exam, is up to my discretion to decide whether I will give you a make-up exam on the next class day following the exam.  There is no make-up for the final exam.

Calculators without web access are allowed. Calculators without web access can be used for the exams and the final.  You will need a calculator that performs regular arithmetic operations and evaluates exponents.  A calculator with statistical functions is not necessary.



### Grading

Your course grade is based on homework, project assignments, quizzes, midterm exams, and a comprehensive final exam. The percentage breakdown for each component is as follows:

- 15% Interactive Online Homework (9 modules)
- 25% 10 Project Assignments
- 15% 11 Online (OLI) Checkpoint Quizzes
- 30% 2 Two-hour Exams (15% each)
- 15% Final Exam

Your final grade will be determined according to the following scale:

- A: 90 – 100%
- B: 80 – 89%
- C: 70 – 79%
- D/F: below 60%



### Extra Credit

- Students can receive 2 extra credit points by completing 20 hours of free math tutoring at the Learning Resource Center in Room 112 on the 1st floor.
- Complete the attached [Tutoring Record sheet](../public/LRC-Time-Sheet.pdf) by having the tutor sign the sheet after each tutoring appointment.
- Appointments are available Mon-Thu, 9:00 a.m.-8 p.m; Fri, 9:00 a.m.-4 p.m; Sat, 10:00 a.m.– 4:00 p.m.



### Tutoring at BCC

Free math tutoring is available at the Learning Resource Center (LRC) in Room 113 (Mon-Th, 9:00am-8:00pm; Fri 9:00am-4:00pm; Sat 10:00am-4:00pm). Please make appointments in advance at the front floor.



### Attendance

- Number of absences may not exceed 4 classes.
- Every additional absence beyond 4 absences requires that you submit documentation.
- With one undocumented absence beyond 4 absences, I reserve the right to drop you from the course.
- While attending class, please help to maintain a decent learning environment.
- Return to class on-time after each break. Disruptive persons will be asked to leave the classroom. 
- Please be considerate of others; turn off your cell phones and put them away. 
- Students routinely checking/using phones will be asked to leave the classroom.
- I will take roll at a random time. If you are not present while I’m taking roll, you will be marked absent.
- If you leave early after I took roll, you will be marked absent.



### Withdrawal

The instructor may elect to drop you from the class if you miss more than six days of class. However, it is your responsibility to officially drop the course should you decide to do so, otherwise you may receive an "F". The last day to Withdraw from regular session classes and receive a "W" for this semester is Thursday April 26.


### Cheating Policy

Cheating is a very serious offense that I will not tolerate. If you are caught cheating on a homework assignment or during a test I will give you an F.



### Disabilities

Students with learning and/or physical disabilities can register in the PSSD office on the 2nd floor.  You may be entitled to extra time for test-taking and other services.  You can register any time during the semester, but entitlements are not retroactive.



### Student Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will:

- Representation: Represent relevant information in various mathematical or algorithmic forms. (conversion of words to mathematical symbols and graphs)
 
- Calculation: Calculate accurately and comprehensively.
 
- Interpretation: Interpret information presented in mathematical or algorithmic forms. (for example, interpretations of equations, graphs, diagrams, tables)
 
- Application/Analysis: Draw appropriate conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing the limits of this analysis. (problem solving)
 
- Communication: Explain quantitative evidence and analysis. (conversion of mathematical symbols and graphs to words)
